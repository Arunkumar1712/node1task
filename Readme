NodeJS File System Project
This project demonstrates a simple Node.js application that utilizes the file system module to create and manage files with timestamps. It also includes functionality to read file names from a directory.

Features:

File Writing: The application allows users to create files with current timestamps.
By using this url you can write the file :"https://node1task.onrender.com/createfile"

File Reading: Users can retrieve and display file names from the directory.
By using this url you can read the file :"https://node1task.onrender.com/readfile"

Deployment
The project has been deployed on Render and can be accessed here
URl ("https://node1task.onrender.com/").


**Note:** Please be aware that there might be a discrepancy in the displayed timestamps between your local system and the Render environment. This is due to differences in the timezone settings or server configurations. While the timestamps generated on your local system reflect your local timezone, the timestamps generated on Render may be based on a different timezone or server configuration. As a result, you may notice variations in the displayed time. However, the functionality of the application remains unaffected by this difference.
